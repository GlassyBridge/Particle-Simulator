# Particle Simulation

A customizable 2D particle simulation built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas.  
Particles interact with each other and respond to user input, supporting features like collision, mouse interaction, multithreaded calculation.

## Features

- **Collision**: particles collide with eachother
- **Mouse interaction**: allows you to push and pull on particles.
- **Connected particles**: draws a faint line between particles.
- **Adjustable parameters**: all parameters are able to be changed from the control panels.
- **Tool tips**: tells you what each parameter does.

Everything after this is not that impressive

- **Boundary check**: in collaboration (¯\_(ツ)_/¯) with the responsive windows, the boundaries of the particles adjust.
- **Gravity**: particles go down.
- **Select**: You can select particles and edit their properties.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser using live server.
3. Use the control panel to:
   - Change parameters.

You can alternatively head to (this_website)[https://glassybridge.github.io/Particle-Simulator] to try it out.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser.
- No external dependencies (since it is built using vanila JS).
